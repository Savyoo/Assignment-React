Description:
We need to develop a web application that maintains information of different companies and users in the relational database. Design & implement this application and demonstrate the functionality.

Following is the list of functionalities that we need to implement in this application:

1. Add a Company [Name, City]
2. Add a User [Name, Email, Phone]
3. Allocate a User to one or more Companies
4. List Users [Name, Email, Phone, Allocated Companies (comma separated string)]

Notes:
• Implement backend for this web application that provides RESTful APIs.
• Assume a suitable authentication mechanism but no need to implement it now.
• Populate API for #1 and #2, in database manually.
• It is must to implement #3 and #4 as APIs.
